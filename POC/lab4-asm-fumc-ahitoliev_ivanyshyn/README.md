# Lab work <mark>4</mark>: <mark>Writing assembly functions</mark>

OS: LINUX

## Prerequisites

gcc required

### Compilation

Compilation is automatic, makefiles used to create executables. Type
```
make
```
in desired directory.

## Work division
Ihor - sort.s, main assembler files
Andrii - somefunc.s, main_c.c files, makefiles

### Usage

After running make command, navigate to executable file (either call_from_c or call_from_s) and run, for example:
```
./call_from_c
```

### Results

As a result, we, as a team, were able to practice in writing programs of different complexity in Assembly, gained

deeper understanding of low-level programming, debugging Assembly code.
